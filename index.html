						<p>Hello world! I work on developing scientific codes to simulate and theoretically understand the inner workings of various astrophysical phenomena. 
							I also try to implement the growing advances in the field of Machine Learning in my project pipelines to aid this understanding. While I have worked on 
							phenomology ranging from scales of protoplanetary disks to galaxy clusters, I am now settling towards galactic and extragalactic phenomena combining studies
							of kinetic particle interactions with Magnetohydrodynamic turbulence (General Relativistic and otherwise) to understand stucture formation and 
							feedback phenomena more fundamentally.

								<h3>Cosmic ray diffusion in interstellar medium</h3>
								<p>Cosmic ray propagation, especially at test particle scales are considered to be strictly 
									dependent on the averaged magnetic field structure itself. There has been very little attention given to
									the effects of underlying Magnetohydrodynamic parameters on the diffusion behaviour of 
									cosmic rays. One of such parameters is the driving mode that governs the way in which turbulence is driven in gas, 
									and in turn how the magnetic field structure evolves and thus indirectly the CR diffusion. As part 
									of my thesis, I was supervised by <a href="https://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~chfeder/">Christoph Federrath</a> 
									and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/amitseta90/">Amit Seta</a> to develop MHD-Test Particle 
									integration and analysis pipeline to study the effect of turbulence driving on CR diffusion. This 
									involved forming scaling relationships between diffusion parameters and Alfv√©n Mach number, CR energies while
									comparing the obtained scalings over different modes of driving. We also obtained interesting results on the 
									regimes of diffusion at these scales. [Paper in prep!]

								<h3>Virial mass estimation of galaxy clusters using GNNs</h3>
								<p>Graph Neural Networks are a very exciting tool gaining recent impetus in the Machine 
									Learning community, as well as Astronomy and Astrophysics due to it's performance on 
									large, unstructured data and their abilty to capture spatial information more efficiently through 
									the use of computational graph based operations. Anothe advantage they hold is in terms of 
									scalability as graphs can inherently be partitioned that enables them to be effectively distributed 
									over nodes in HPC clusters. All this sparks massive potential with astronomical datasets 
									which are inherently unstructured and span terabytes of data. I am working with 
									<a href="https://franciscovillaescusa.github.io">Francisco-Villaescusa Navarro</a> 
									to apply GNNs to infer galaxy cluster masses using the UCHUU dataset and SDSS4 catalogs for training and testing 
									respectively. GNNs are trickier to build and have to be trained carefully to ensure geometrical invariance 
									which is key to modelling cosomological simulations.

								<h3>Structure formation in modified gravity cosmologies</h3>
								<p>Modified gravity theories are gaining impetus in recent years as an alternative 
									to dark energy understanding of the observed accelerated expansion of the universe. 
									I collaborated with Oleksii Sokoliuk and <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/pradyumnkumarsahoo/Profile">PK Sahoo</a> 
									among other collaborators to work on various projects involving large scale structure 
									formation and exotic compact objects in Modified Gravities. These works included 
									radiative transfer calculation using test particle orbital motion solutions representing 
									<a href="https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202244358">accretion flows around diffierent wormhole geomtries</a>, 
									and using SPH simulations to model <a href="https://https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stad968">large scale structure formation in f(Q) gravity cosmology</a>.
									A common theme in these studies is constraining initial condition parameters from observed 
									data to generate initial conditions for the simulations from where we extract observables 
									for large-scale structure such as  density/temperature/mean molecular weight fields, matter power 
									spectrum (both 2/3D, with/without redshift space distortions), bispectrum, two-point correlation function 
									and halo mass function. [Further studies in this series of papers under prep!]

								<h3>Planet mass and position estimation in protoplanetary disks using CNNs</h3>
								<p>Current observation techniques do not allow us to identify young exoplanets forming 
									in protoplanetary disks. Thus, most of the current planet formation theories build 
									upon planet masses predicted by analytical means. However. these estimates depend on 
									definitions of gap width and gap depth from observed PPD data, and given multiple such 
									definitions we have poor reproducability of such results. Assuming gaps form through 
									planets opening them (there are various other means of gap opening too), we use computer 
									vision to overcome this issue of reproducability. Working with a team of researchers from 
									all over the globe, me and <a href="https://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/sayantan-auddy/">Sayantan Auddy</a> 
									built and trained CNNs on a PPD image dataset that is synthetically generated (hydro sims + radiative transfer), 
									geometrically invariant, and degenerate in gap space to predict planet masses and positions given dust 
									continuum images of radio wavelengths such as those obtained by ALMA/VLA. [Paper in prep!]

									<h3>Stellar population synthesis to understand Humphreys-Davidson limit</h3>
									<p>The Humphreys-Davidon limit is a very famous unsolved problem in stellar astronomy.
										The non-existence or non-observability of highly luminous massive stars has been attributed 
										to a wide variety of probable reasons but the true stellar populations have never been accurately
										recovered. As part of an undergraduate summer internship at TAU, I worked with <a href="http://www.astro.tau.ac.il/~arcavi/">Iair Arcavi</a> and Avishai Gilkis
										to code a synthetic population synthesis software that formed complex stellar populations 
										with informed assumptions on star formation history, multiplicity and mixing. This work also used 
										evolution tracks with different compositions corresponding to LMC, SMC, and the Milky Way.

									<h3>Constraing dense matter EoS in neutron stars usning bayesian analysis and symbolic regression</h3>
									<p>There are several methods in literature to constraion neutron star dense matter EoS. These include both 
										parametric approaches, like spectral parametrisation or piecewise polytope models where we try to fit 
										candidate EoS as best as possible with minimum parameters, and parameter agnostic ones, where we take a 
										large number of EoS functionals with literature informed ranges on pressure-density space to recover candidate EoS. 
										Apart from these, there is also the chiral EFT approach for low densities where we know the nuclear physics, and either 
										agnostic or parametric approach in the high density regions where we do not know the Nuclear physics. I explored 
										combinations of inferring nuclear empirical parameters for low densities and 3-piece piecewise polytrope for 
										higher densities, with the transition densities obtained using bauyesian evidence. The data was obtained from 
										3 spot mass-radius samples from <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1912.05705">Miller et al.</a> and LIGO data from 
										GW170817 and GW190425 merger events. I also compared results from the bayesian proceedure against symbolic regression 
										to implement and explore methods discussed in <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2303.03192">Tenachi et al.</a>

						<h2>Life Outside Astronomy</h2>
						<p>I closely follow football, cricket and MMA. I have been a Manchester United fan since 2008 which was pretty much around the time 
							I started watching the game itself. Watching a game at Old Trafford is a dream, so photos will follow soon (hopefully)!
						</p>
						<p> Apart from sports, I love travelling, listening to rap and various rock genres, watching anime and reading manga. 
							I am particularly a huge fan of One Piece and HunterXHunter.
						</p>
						<p> On the social front I was actively involved with the National Service Scheme during my sophomore year in 2019. I worked within the 
							capacity of a volunteer taking part in events involving the upliftment of old age homes and collection of data concerning domestic 
							abuse in suburban regions around Hyderabad.
